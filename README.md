<h1>Task Randomizer</h1>

<p>This simple page application is destined to the undecided people just like me</p>
<p>Its purpose is to help you when you have many things to do but don't know what to do first</p>
<p>After you create your tasks, just press the Randomize button, set how much time you have available, and that's it... A wild random task will appear for you!</p>

<br/>

<p>The application is still running the beta version. The <strong>view-tasks</strong> feature will be released soon. This feature will let you list all the pending tasks and all the completed tasks, and sort them by title, duration, status, newest or oldest.
</p>

<p>Another work-in-progress feature is the responsive mobile interface. Currently, only the desktop perspective is supported. Use mobile perspective at your own risk... <br/> (of being annoyed with poor interface)
